# Course Project

This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course, INFO 340, at the University of Washington's iSchool.

## Stage 4
For stage 4 of the project, our team built upon the functionality and user-flow of the previous applications using both react and firebase. This version runs similarly to our previous iterations, paying special attention to functions which aim to improve the overall user experience and interaction. In order to improve upon functionality, we implemented user signup, log in/out and the ability for users to save their unique "watch later" list, as well as adding a search page so the user is able to search for key terms. We reduced friction by allowing the user to browse through movies and the movie's similar movie list seamlessly. To strengthen our user experience, we removed distracting elements from our application, organized our react coding style and documentation and used a consistent color scheme.

**Issues fixed**: Components organized, libraries implemented, /.interacted page renamed to /.description, hours removed from footer, div.inputs have role form, <button> no longer has role button, "Content" renamed to "MovieDescription", errors handled and extraneous comments removed
