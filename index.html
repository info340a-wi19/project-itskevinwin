            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                When I got home, I went around the entire house and I talked to many
                of my friends. I asked them two questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What are small personal problems that bother you that you wish
                        could be fixed through a web application?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What are some problems you have faced since you have arrived
                        at the University of Washington that you wish they did better?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                I got a lot of answers regarding the personal problems, but many of
                ideas were not feasible for a web application. Instead, a common theme
                that showed up was whether or not I could make something that could
                guide them through many different majors because many of them are
                starting their junior year without a major and that can be tough to
                go through mentally. The problem is that most of the majors at UW are
                very competitive, so it's hard for new students to get into their dream
                major if they were not directly admitted into it. Thus, while they chase
                their dream major, they never come up with a backup plan incase they
                don't get into their major and this can be a real problem when they
                are at face with a rejection letter. This is the reality of many
                students on campus, and it was once a reality of mine until I got
                into Informatics on my second try!
            </p>

            <h3>Information Technology Problem</h3>
            <p>
                One of the problems with information technology in this space is that
                students are not well informed of the many major options they have. Yes,
                a student can go to an advisor, but what if they are booked and they
                simply don't have time to go see one? There needs to be more options as
                to how they get retrieve more information quickly to help them guide down
                a path or two. Students are also not well informed about how the classes
                they have already taken can actually be applied to multiple different
                majors other than their dream major. Lastly, many students do not think
                of creating a backup plan. I know I didn't, and I was almost too late
                when I realized. Every student can achieve success, they just need a
                little guidance when doing so.
            </p>

            <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                One of the best existing solutions for students to use that enables
                them to plan their classes is UW's MyPlan. This app enables to you
                pick what major you want to pursue and shows you all of the
                prerequisites and requirements to graduate with that degree. Along
                with that, it also shows what courses you have completed that fit
                under that degree and the ones that don't. This is a handy tool
                if you know exactly what you are doing because it can help guide
                you to that end goal.

            <h2>Proposed Application</h2>

            <h3>Application Description</h3>
            <p>
                MyPath(s) would be an interactive tool that students may use when they
                are in need of quick and easy guidance when it comes to planning the
                rest of their time at the university. Students would be able to use MyPath(s)
                to input what classes they have taken at UW and the app will create
                a list of majors that those classes are a prerequisite to as well what other
                classes they must complete to apply to that major. This will also enable them
                to see what other majors are similar to the main one they are interested
                in, ones they may have never heard of. This application is not to be
                used to go down one path, but instead give you the ability to choose
                what path you want to take out of the many and have a backup plan just
                incase.
            </p>

            <h3>Application Users</h3>
            <p>
                The users for this application would be the many students at the University
                of Washington's campus as this would be hard to intergrate into other
                schools since course names and numbers are different everywhere and majors
                may vary. This application will mainly focus on the freshmen and sophomores
                on campus, as well as all of the students that are not in their major yet.
            </p>

            <h3>Interacting with MyPath(s)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Users will first choose 2-3 different main majors that they are
                    interested in
                </li>
                <li>
                    Then they will input the classes they have completed manually by typing
                    them in, or they can choose from a list of courses that are sorted
                    by subject.
                </li>
                <li>
                    MyPath(s) will take the related courses they have taken and the majors they
                    selected as their favorites and then display a list of majors and their descriptions.
                    It will also display the kind of jobs that can be obtained with that certain degree.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The user will then click on a major that peaks their interest and then it
                    will display the other classes they have to complete to apply to this major,
                    as well as the courses they have already taken that apply to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    They can then go back and look at other majors that they may be interested in.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Solution to the Problem</h3>
            <p>
                This is a solution to the problem that I described at the top of the page
                because many students are lost and they have no idea where to look first.
                Having something that is so easy and accessible will make their time at
                UW a lot smoother, and it will enable them to walk around with more confidence
                because it will feel as if they are finally doing something right. This will
                help students create backup plans out of the classes they have already taken, so
                that they aren't wasting any time because time here is so valuable. Using this
                application will allow them to explore majors that they may have never heard of
                and it may be exactly what they were looking for! This is the complete opposite
                of MyPlan because when you are using MyPlan, you already know what major you want
                to do and you can only see if your classes fit for that particular major. You are
                unable to see what other majors you are able to apply for with the classes you
                have taken without auditing another major one by one.
